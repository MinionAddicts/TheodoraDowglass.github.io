                  <strong>This allows vitial statisics to be automatically monitored</strong>
                  <p>For example, heart rate, breathing and blood oxygen levels. This allows the medical professionals to spend more 
                      time treating patients rather than having to constantly monitor everyone. And if levels get into dangerous levels, they
                      can be alerted quickly. Different inputs are used to measure these and each my be interpreted differently. For example, to measure
                      blood oxygen levels, a light is shone onto small blood vessels in the paitents fingertip using a small machine. The oxygen reflects some of the light back,
                      the level of light detected back relates to the amount of oxygen so must be computed in this way. Blood flow (heart rate) is measured in a similar way; by
                      detetcting wavelengths reflected back - this is called photoplethysmography. With the advancements in technology, both these measurements can now be taken at home on
                      a small wearbale device: detetction data is complied with data from the accelerometer and put through algorithms to determine and output correct results the user can understand.

                  <p>Video calls and telephone appointments have become more and more prevalent due to the pandemic and means patients
                      dont have to travel to an appointment. Further more, the developments of electronic messaging through emails and other apps allow 
                      for instant tranfer of messages between doctors and pracitces - espically important in time sensitive tasks which the medical staff 
                      deal with daily. This ease of communication also allows for GPs and hospitals to form 'medical groups' - group of centres that are linked 
                      togther. This means a patient signs up for one doctor but then has the flexability of going to all the clinics in the group; as data is shared 
                      between them all electronically (kept on central server they can all connect to). This also means that different pracitices can specialize and the paitent can go to the appropriate one to get the
                      best advice and treatment.

                    <p>Computer programs are constantly used in hospitals in order to interpret data collected by machines like MRIs, 
                        so that it can been shown in a way that can be understood by humans e.g. showing an image of brain scan.

                      When a radio frequency current is puled through the patient, the protons are stimulated. When the radiofrequency feild is turned off, sensors detect the enegry release from these
                      protons. Of course, a person would not be able to understand this data, so computer programs tranform it into 3D models that can be studied. Without
                      computers to control the machines and produce an understandable output, we would know much less about the body.

                      aren't forced into having to pay for large, powerful computers that they may not need all the time. They can pay just for what they need, or

                    <p>Due to the large range of similar symptoms relating to a wide range of diseases and problems, it can be very difficult to 
                      pin point what the issue is. Often a patient is guided through a series of questions leading to a final result, or natural language

                      a severe condition. As patients can do this all from the comfort of their own home, they are more likely to do it and saves time talking to a doctor if urgeny
                      care is requried. Also computers can hold a bigger bank of data than a doctor or nurse can in their heads, so any more obscure conditions wouldn't be forgotten.

          <h4>Personal Story</h4>
          <img src="uncle-fred.jpg" alt="Uncle Fred head shot" style="float:right">
          <p>In 2018, my uncle Fred was rushed to hospital after a suspected blood clot in the brain. 
            It was too long after the usual window for the pescription of blood clotting drugs as usually 
            after this time they woudln't work as well and could cause excessive bleeding in the brain. 
            However they took him for an MRI and after studying the results, the doctors decided that the drugs could still work. 
            He was given them, they worked, his life was saved, and he was discharged soon after.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this situation many of the above uses of computers were applied:
            <ul>
              <li>Patient monitoring throughout his time in the hospital to ensure a suitbale body condition was maintianed</li>
              <li>Electronic Health Records to note down what had happened, look up past treatments and any drug allergies he may have</li>
              <li>Medical Scans; as of course the MRI played a major role in determining his treatment</li>
            </ul>
            Without the application of computers in this senario, doctors would have had to go off personal views in deciding treatments
            rather than having an evidnece based approach due to the results of the MRI. I would suspect the threatment would've been different and 
            most probably less painfree.
