   Timeline of Computer Science in Security </h2>
  <p style="text-align: center; padding:10px 80px;"> But technology hasn't always been this enhanced. Only in recent years has computer science played such a fundamental part in
  keeping data secure and preventing malware from infecting computers and causing system failures. The field of cyber security first started when the internet had even been invented.

   During the pandemic, there was a 44% rise in ransomware attacks across the health sector alone, while other sectors faced a 22% increase in attacks.
   With 46% of the working population being asked to work from home, communication and security infrastructure proved more important than ever. 
   Computer sciencenst, programmers and mathematicians came together to develop infection control systems such as the NHS track and trace app.

  With the exponential rise of the use of technology in many daily activities, the amount of programmers and computer scientists needed to maintain all 
  technology means that computational and cyber security has also opened up the job market. According to Gov.uk, a total of 393,257 cyber security-related 
  job postings over the past 3 years, ranging from security specialists to ethical hackers. With all the jobs openings, safer systems and more efficient life-styles,
  the use and implementation of computer science in security makes our future look very promising.
